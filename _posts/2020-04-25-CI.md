During the summer of 2019, I was a part of Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute's Summer Scholars (RISS) research program. As one of 35 undergrads from all over the world, we were given the opportunity to do funded research with some of the best robotics researchers in the world. 

The RISS program includes weekly lab tours, two workshops and competitions put on by UBTech and DJI, and a journal paper and poster presentation at the end of the program. 

During my summer, I primarily worked on the Aerial Manipulation and Contact Inspection projects in the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org). This project involved developing a full system on a custom drone for aerial manipulation and inspection. I also worked on developing a robust state estimate pipeline utilizing the Intel T265 Tracking camera.
