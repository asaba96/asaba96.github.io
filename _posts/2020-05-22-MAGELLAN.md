As part of the Pitt Robotics & Automation Society (Pitt RAS), I co-led a team with Andrew Lobos and Kaylene Stocking to develop an autonomous RC car.

In April 2019, we competed in the Nation Robotics Competition, Autonomous Vehicle Challenge. Our team ended up winning first place in the Secondary tier and had the fastest run time overall.
