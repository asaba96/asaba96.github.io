Hello! My name is Andrew and I am a Systems/Sofware Enginer at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute in the [AirLab](theairlab.org).

I recently graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, Swanson School of Engineering, in Computer Engineering, where I won an award for the Most Outstanding Graduate in Computer Engineering. 

I love robots, especially flying ones, and the potential they provide. With my work, I hope to push the frontiers of robotics and help bring robotics to our daily lives. 

Outside of work, I work to mentor and bring robotics to more people. For example, Imentor a robotics team at Pitt that is making autonomous ground vehicles to compete in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and Indy Autonomous Challenge as part of
Pitt's [Robotics and Automation Society](pittras.org).
