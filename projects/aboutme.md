Hello! My name is Andrew and I recently graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, Swanson School of Engineering, studying Computer Engineering. I love robots, especially flying ones, and am currently a Research Associate II in the [AirLab](theairlab.org) at Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Institute. I also mentor a robotics team at Pitt that is making autonomous ground vehicles to compete in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and FSAE Germany Autonomy events as part of
Pitt's [Robotics and Automation Society](pittras.org).
